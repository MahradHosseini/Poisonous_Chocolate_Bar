**Welcome to Poisonous Chocolate Bar Game:**  
The rows and columns are indexed according to the demonstration above.

The game has been developed with two modes: AI vs. Human, and Human vs. Human. At the beginning of the game you can choose the mode you want to play, the number of rows and columns for your chocolate bar, and the position of the poisonous tile. Also, in AI mode you can choose who should make the first move.  

The AI mode utilizes Minimax Search Algorithm to find the best move or countermove against you, the state of the bar will be shown every step along with the number of nodes that AI counted to come up with its move.  

In Multi-Player mode you will have two players. The system will ask you to enter the name of the each player and will tell you whose turn it is to play at each state.  

The winner will be shown on the screen in both modes.  

Hope you enjoy!
